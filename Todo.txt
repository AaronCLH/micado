- linear.dwg:

Admin Automation  
- Release Building Script (doesn't matter for next release)
  given a release number $n$, the script should automatically generate the micado-$n$ directory and the micado-$n$.zip archive in $MICADO/pub/
  it should also
  * put the right release number in the $MICADO/pub/micado-$n$/README.txt
  * warn if a release with the same name already exists
