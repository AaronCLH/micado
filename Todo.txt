Bugs
- linear.dwg: 
  Why is the super valve not taken into account in instructions?
  Probably related to handling topology by points?
  Actually, sometimes related to the big flow within small flow issue.
  Works more often than not.

- Disposing of DBObject
  - how essential is it to always dispose?
  - if essential, 
    * track down segmentPolyline (sometimes, it creates a new object and sometimes not)
    * cache objectids instead of objects for InstructionChip?
	  * this would require getting rid of Chip and just having methods for required functionality
	  
Research
- Specifying instructions by the flow layer
  
Admin Automation  
- Release Building Script (doesn't matter for next release)
  given a release number $n$, the script should automatically generate the micado-$n$ directory and the micado-$n$.zip archive in $MICADO/pub/
  it should also
  * put the right release number in the $MICADO/pub/micado-$n$/README.txt
  * warn if a release with the same name already exists
