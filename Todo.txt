Bugs
V InstructionChip cannot be constructed if there are no flow segments while there are flow punches.
  -- needs user-friendly failure.

- linear.dwg: 
  Why is the super valve not taken into account in instructions?
  Probably related to handling topology by points?
  Actually, sometimes related to the big flow within small flow issue.
  Works more often than not.
	  
Research
- Specifying instructions by the flow layer
  
Admin Automation  
- Release Building Script (doesn't matter for next release)
  given a release number $n$, the script should automatically generate the micado-$n$ directory and the micado-$n$.zip archive in $MICADO/pub/
  it should also
  * put the right release number in the $MICADO/pub/micado-$n$/README.txt
  * warn if a release with the same name already exists
