Bugs
- linear.dwg: 
  Why is the super valve not taken into account in instructions?
  Probably related to handling topology by points?
  Actually, sometimes related to the big flow within small flow issue.
  Works more often than not.

- Disposing of DBObject
  - According to http://discussion.autodesk.com/thread.jspa?threadID=614533
    it seems ONLY essential to dispose of DBObjects that have not been opened during a transaction, 
	therefore, you're safe with InstructionChip, 
	but you need to track down those new Polyline in the routing process.
	Kean confirmed this.
	It seems almost unnecessary to have Chip be IDisposable then?
	  
Research
- Specifying instructions by the flow layer
  
Admin Automation  
- Release Building Script (doesn't matter for next release)
  given a release number $n$, the script should automatically generate the micado-$n$ directory and the micado-$n$.zip archive in $MICADO/pub/
  it should also
  * put the right release number in the $MICADO/pub/micado-$n$/README.txt
  * warn if a release with the same name already exists
