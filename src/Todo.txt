TODO list

Pressure
- Catch-up with BioCAD in terms of instruction generations
  * export image
  * export basic instructions (in terms of open/closed valves)

Research
- Specifying instructions by the flow layer
  
Automation
- Installation Script (must have for next release)
  the script should
  * ask for an installation directory
  * figure out autocad's directory
  * just take care of all the path renamings
  
- Release Building Script (nice to have for next release)
  given a release number $n$, the script should automatically generate the micado-$n$ directory and the micado-$n$.zip archive in $MICADO/pub/
  it should also
  * put the right release number in the $MICADO/pub/micado-$n$/README.txt
  * warn if a release with the same name already exists
  
Thoughts
- OK for dev scripts to be in Python
  Perhaps better for user scripts to be in F# (so as to limit dependencies)
